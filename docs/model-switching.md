title: Fast Model & Variant Switching
description: |
  How to quickly switch models and thinking levels using agent markdown files and Discord commands instead of the /model menu.
---

## Why agents are faster than /model

The `/model` command requires clicking through 3-4 dropdown menus every time you want to switch. With agent files you define a model + variant + permissions once, restart kimaki, and from then on you can switch with a single `/sonnet-high-agent` command. No menus, instant.

This is especially useful when you regularly switch between models during a session, for example using a cheap model for boilerplate and a powerful one for architecture decisions.

## Creating agent files

Create `.md` files in your project's `.opencode/agent/` directory. Each file becomes a selectable agent in the `/agent` dropdown and gets its own `/<name>-agent` slash command.

The file only needs YAML frontmatter. The body is an optional system prompt override.

### Examples

**.opencode/agent/sonnet-high.md** - Sonnet with high thinking, auto-allows questions and plan entry so it doesn't stall on permission prompts:

```yaml
---
description: Claude Sonnet with high thinking
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
variant: high
permission:
  question: allow
  plan_enter: allow
---
```

**.opencode/agent/opus-max.md** - Opus with maximum thinking budget. Use for complex architecture and debugging tasks:

```yaml
---
description: Claude Opus with max thinking
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514
variant: max
permission:
  question: allow
  plan_enter: allow
---
```

**.opencode/agent/gpt5.md** - GPT 5 Codex for fast iteration:

```yaml
---
description: GPT 5 Codex
mode: primary
model: openai/gpt-5.3-codex
permission:
  question: allow
  plan_enter: allow
---
```

**.opencode/agent/gemini-low.md** - Gemini with low thinking for quick cheap tasks. Lower temperature for more deterministic output:

```yaml
---
description: Gemini 3 pro, low thinking
mode: primary
model: google/gemini-3-pro-preview
variant: low
temperature: 0.3
permission:
  question: allow
  plan_enter: allow
---
```

**.opencode/agent/safe-build.md** - Locked down agent that can only read and edit, no bash or external tools. Useful for untrusted refactoring tasks:

```yaml
---
description: Build agent, no bash or external tools
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
variant: high
color: "#E67E22"
steps: 50
permission:
  bash: deny
  question: allow
  plan_enter: allow
---
```

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | string | Model ID as `provider/model` (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `variant` | string | Thinking level: `low`, `high`, `max` (available values depend on model) |
| `mode` | string | `primary` (top-level agent) or `all` (usable as both top-level and subagent) |
| `description` | string | Shown in the `/agent` selector and agent autocomplete |
| `permission` | object | Auto-allow/deny permissions: `question`, `plan_enter`, `bash`, `edit`, etc. |
| `temperature` | number | Sampling temperature (e.g. `0.3` for deterministic, `1.0` for creative) |
| `top_p` | number | Top-p nucleus sampling |
| `steps` | number | Max agentic iterations before forcing a text-only response |
| `hidden` | boolean | Hide from the agent selector UI |
| `color` | string | Hex color (e.g. `"#FF5733"`) or theme color (`primary`, `warning`, etc.) |
| `options` | object | Extra provider-specific parameters passed through to the model API |

Any unknown frontmatter keys are automatically merged into `options` and forwarded to the provider, so you can pass provider-specific parameters directly in frontmatter without nesting them under `options`.

### Activating

After creating or editing agent files, restart kimaki so it picks up the new slash commands. Then switch with:
- `/agent` dropdown to pick from all available agents
- `/<name>-agent` slash command for instant one-step switching (e.g. `/sonnet-high-agent`, `/opus-max-agent`, `/gpt5-agent`)

## Setting variant via /model

The `/model` command includes a variant picker. After selecting a provider and model, if the model supports thinking levels a dropdown appears. The variant is stored alongside the model at whatever scope you choose (session, channel, or global).
